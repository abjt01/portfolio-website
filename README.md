This is my personal website and portfolio, built from scratch with Next.js, Tailwind, and a stack of tools I actually use every day. It’s minimal, honest, and focused on what matters: building, shipping, and learning.

You’ll find a quick view of who I am, my tech stack, what I’m building (like Promptly), and a few projects I’m proud of. No filler, just the essentials.
